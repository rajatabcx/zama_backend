product upsell email

while creating from frontend,
ask them if they want to add a discount

Then, call the api

api will receive the data - variantId, discount percentage and code

will create a checkout with variantId for every user in the list and repeat that for every user and then send it

create a discount with the data - later

the email will have the links of checkout email data and recommendation for the product data.
